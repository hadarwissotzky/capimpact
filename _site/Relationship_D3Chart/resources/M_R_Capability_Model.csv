Bids are resubmitted from end of July through first week of August during the rebid process. CMS issues final decision on bids around September 1 of each year, approving or rejecting the bids. Approved bids mean carriers may market/sell those plan products.

As the bid process continues, downstream partners are communicated changes so they can continue to make system updates to support the upcoming year’s plans.

The entities send an electronic Encounter transmission (daily, weekly, etc.) for 837I (institutional) or 837P (Professional) to UHG by means of an Electronic Data Interface (EDI) Clearinghouse.  
The Clearinghouse acknowledges the provider transaction and validates the encounter data.  All identified errors are sent back to the delegated entity as an EDI 277 daily report for resolution.  Success files are move to the United Frontend Engine (UFE) for additional processing; balance check, duplicate file check, member pick for each encounter, determine destination (PES, NICE, COSMOS), etc.  Western Region Professional encounters are sent to the PES to generate required delegated entity reports (1050).  Western Region Institutional encounters are sent to NICE, where the CL0307 reports are generated.  All Eastern Region delegated entities are sent to COSMOS.  We are contractually obligated to send encounter information back to providers to support their reconciliation efforts.
Once encounter processing is complete, each claims platform will automatically send a file to OptumInsight EDPS for CMS reporting.  
KEY POINTS
78% of the Delegated Providers submit Encounters through Transunion and 22% through OptumInsight.  
Reimbursement Modernization initiative has started supporting delegated providers in 2014, prior to that all delegated providers were only supported on the NICE claims platform.
Encounter information sent back to providers is in a printed report format (i.e. not electronic).  However, Reimbursement Modernization phase 2 is moving to electronic medium. 
Eastern region Delegated Entities are processed on COSMOS, Reimbursement Modernization Program is building out delegated / capitated functionality on the COSMOS platform.  This effort is scheduled to continue over the next 3 – 5 years.
