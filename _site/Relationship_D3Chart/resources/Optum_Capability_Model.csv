391,2.2.6.2.1.4,Surgical & Invasive Diagnostic Procedures - Optum,"Determination of the nature of a disease or ailment. A clinical diagnosis is based on the medical history and physical examination of the patient: it may be confirmed with X-Rays, CAT Scans (Computerized Axial Tomography), MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging), and other laboratory tests. Diagnosis by physical examination includes ascertaining temperature, pulse, and blood pressure and involves the use of palpation, to detect enlarged organs and other abnormalities; tapping, to delineate some of the internal organs; and listening, to interpret sounds from organs such as the heart and lungs. Instruments that facilitate physical examination include the sphygmomanometer for blood pressure; the stethoscope for listening to the heart and lungs; the ophthalmoscope to examine the inner eye; and the laryngoscope and bronchoscope

 to view the larynx, windpipe, and other air passages. Recent innovations in electronics have made it possible for any of these devices to be fitted with video cameras and lights, so that the interior of the body can be viewed on video monitors and recorded on videotape for future reference. In diagnostic tests, the blood, urine, tissues, and other excretions and secretions of the body are examined for evidence of chemical imbalance, cellular change, and the presence of pathogenic organisms. Exploratory surgery and the insertion of visual equipment through a small incision (e.g., laparoscopy and arthroscopy) may be used to assist in diagnosis.


Invasive Procedures:
These tests involve injecting radioactive substances known as radionuclides (for instance, thallium) into the patient’s bloodstream. As the radioactive substances flow through the patient’s cardiovascular system, scans and computer-generated images are taken to detect how well the heart’s chambers are working, how good blood supply to the heart is, and whether or not any heart muscle has been damaged by a heart attack.

Nuclear imaging - may be combined with an exercise stress test to augment the accuracy of the results obtained. In such cases, the radioactive substances injected into the patient are mapped both at the peak of exercise and at rest so as to identify areas where the coronary arteries are narrowed, as well as the extent and severity of the patient’s blood flow abnormalities.

Cardiac Catheterisation / Coronary Angiography
Cardiac catheterisation is commonly performed before invasive procedures such as “balloon” angioplasty in order to determine the type and extent of surgery required. A catheter in the form of a thin plastic tube is inserted into an artery or vein in one of the patient’s limbs and directed into the chambers of his heart and the coronary arteries. Once the catheter is in position, the blood pressure, oxygen content of the blood, and pumping ability of the heart can be assessed.

The catheter may also be used to inject a dye into the coronary arteries. As the dye flows through these arteries, X-rays are taken (coronary angiography). The dye shows up as white lines on the X-rays, with disruption or narrowing of the lines indicating areas where the coronary arteries are obstructed.

Trans-Oesophageal Echocardiography
Unlike conventional echocardiography which is non-invasive, in trans-oesophageal echocardiography, a special instrument is inserted into the patient’s throat and passed down his oesophagus (the tube connecting the mouth to the stomach). As part of the oesophagus lies close to the heart, the images captured by the instrument are able to give a very clear picture of the heart’s structure.

Blood tests
Certain substances such as creatinine kinase and troponin are released into the bloodstream when the heart is damaged during a heart attack. Their concentrations peak after a specific period of time from the initial moment of heart attack. Blood tests to detect the presence of these substances are useful in helping doctors to estimate the time of, or to confirm the occurrence of a heart attack. They also help in the detection of any injury which may have been caused to heart muscle due to a heart attack.

Classification Of Heart Disease
Based on the results of the diagnostic tests performed, doctors usually classify a patient’s heart condition based on how severe his symptoms are. The most commonly used classification system in this respect is the New York Heart Association’s Functional Classification, which places patients into one of four categories depending on the extent to which their cardiac problems limit their capacity for physical activity.",GroupCapability L3,421-3023-0

End-of-life care requires a range of decisions, including questions of palliative care, patients' right to self-determination (of treatment, life), medical experimentation, the ethics and efficacy of extraordinary or hazardous medical interventions, and the ethics and efficacy even of continued routine medical interventions. In addition, end-of-life often touches upon rationing and the allocation of resources in hospitals and national medical systems. Such decisions are informed both by technical, medical considerations, economic factors as well as bioethics. In addition, end-of-life treatments are subject to considerations of patient autonomy.

439,2.2.6.3.5,Medication Management - Optum,"Medication therapy management (MTM) is medical care provided by pharmacists whose aim is to optimize drug therapy and improve therapeutic outcomes for patients. Eleven national pharmacy organizations adopted this definition in 2004. 
Medication therapy management includes a broad range of professional activities, including but not limited to performing patient assessment and/or a comprehensive medication review, formulating a medication treatment plan, monitoring efficacy and safety of medication therapy, enhancing medication adherence through patient empowerment and education, and documenting and communicating MTM services to prescribers in order to maintain comprehensive patient care.

Medication therapy management includes five core components: a medication therapy review (MTR), personal medication record (PMR), medication-related action plan (MAP), intervention and/or referral, and documentation and follow-up. A MTR is a systematic process of collecting patient and medication-related information which occurs during the pharmacist-patient encounter. In addition, the MTR assists in the identification and prioritization of medication-related problems. During the MTM encounter, the pharmacist develops a PMR for use by the patient. The PMR includes all prescription and nonprescription products and requires updating as necessary. After assessing and identifying medication-related problems, the pharmacist develops a patient-specific MAP. The MAP is a list of self-management actions necessary to achieve the patient’s specific health goals. In addition, the patient and pharmacist utilize the MAP to record actions and track progress towards health goals. During the MTM session, the pharmacist identifies medication-related problem(s) and determines appropriate intervention(s) for resolution. Often, the pharmacist collaborates with other health care professionals to resolve the identified problem(s). Following the patient encounter and/or intervention, the pharmacist must document his/her encounter and determine appropriate patient follow-up.

Pharmaceutical define care as the provision of drug therapy in order to achieve definite outcomes that improve a patient’s quality of life. Outcomes include cure of a disease, elimination or reduction of a patient’s symptomatology, arresting or slowing of a disease process, and preventing a disease or symptomatology. The process includes pharmacist collaboration with other health care professionals in designing, implementing, and monitoring a therapeutic plan for a patient. Pharmaceutical care focuses on the pharmacist’s role in achieving therapeutic goals to improve the patient’s quality of life.

The Medicare Modernization Act of 2003, requires Medicare Part D prescription drug plans to include medication therapy management services delivered by a qualified healthcare professional, including pharmacists, beginning in 2006. MTM services target beneficiaries who have multiple chronic conditions (such as diabetes, asthma, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and congestive heart failure), take multiple medications, or are likely to incur annual costs above a predetermined level.[3] Medication therapy management is a unique niche for the pharmacy profession, allowing pharmacists to apply their extensive medication knowledge as medication experts with the intent of improving patient outcomes.
